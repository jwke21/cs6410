**Implementing Type Checking for MiniJava**
- Create multiple visitors for the AST
- First pass/passes: gather information


**Object Representation**
- The naive explanation is that an object contains
	1. **Fields** declared in its class and in all superclasses
	2. **Methods** declared in its class and all superclasses
- Actual representation:
	- Each object contains:
		1. **An entry** ("slot") for each field (instance variable)
		2. **A pointer** to a runtime data structure for its class
			1. **Key component**: method dispatch table
	- Basically a C struct
	- Fields hidden by declarations in subclass are still allocated in the object and are accessible from superclass method 

**Method Tables and Inheritance**
- Simple implementation:
	- Method table for each class has pointers to all methods declared in it (a dictionary)
	- Method table also contains a pointer to parent class method table
	- **Method dispatch**:
		1. Look in current table and use if method declared locally
		2. Look in parent class table if not local
		3. Repeat
		4. "Message not understood" if you can't find it after search
	- Actually used/needed in typical implementation of some dynamic languages

**Object Layout**
- Typically fields are allocated sequentially in memory
- Follow processor/OS alignment conventions for struct/object when appropriate/available
	- Including padding if necessary
- Use first word of object for pointer to method table.

**Runtime Type Checking**
- We can use the method table for the class as a "runtime representation" of the class
	- Each class has one vtable at a unique address
- The test for "o instance of C" is
	- Is o's method table pointer == &C

**Optimizations**
- Use added passes to identify inefficiencies in intermediate or target code
- Replace with equivalent but better sequences
	- Equivalent = "has same externally visible behavior"
- "Optimize" overly optimistic: "usually improve" is generally more accurate

**Kinds of Optimizations**:
- **Peephole**: look at adjacent instructions
	- Try to replace adjacent instructions with something faster
- **Local**: look at individual basic blocks
- **Intraprocedural**: look at the whole procedure
	- Commonly called "global"
- **Interprocedural**: look across procedures
	- "whole program" analysis
	- gcc's "link time optimization" is a version of this
- **Larger scope**: usually better optimization but more cost and complexity
	- Analysis is often less precise because of more possibilities
