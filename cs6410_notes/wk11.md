**Kinds of Optimizations**
- **Peephole** - look at adjacent instructions
- **Local** - look at individual basic blocks
- **Intraprocedural** - look at the whole procedure
- **Interprocedural** - look across procedures

**Local Optimizations**:
- **Local Constant Propagation**: If variable assigned a constant, replace downstream uses of the variable with constant (until variable can reassigned)
	- Can enable more constant folding
- **Local Dead Assignment Elimination**: If left hand side of assignment never referenced again before being overwritten, then can delete assignment
	- Dead code elimination
- **Local Common Subexpression Elimination**: Look for repetitions of the same computation. Eliminate them if result won't have changed and no side effects.

**Intraprocedural Optimizations**
- **Loop Induction Variable Elimination**
	- For-loop index is induction variable
	- If used only to index arrays, can rewrite with pointers

**Interprocedural Optimization**: Expand scope of analysis to procedures calling each other

**Data Structures for Optimizations**
- **Control flow graphs (CFG)**: Captures flow of control
- **Data flow graph (DFG)**: Captures flow of data
- **SSA**
